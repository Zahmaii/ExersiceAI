# 🏋️ Exercise AI Web App

This is a multi-page Streamlit application that uses AI and machine learning to:

* 📸 Detect and count exercise reps (Squats, Push-ups, Sit-ups)
* 🎯 Analyze exercise posture accuracy from live camera or uploaded videos
* 📈 Predict future performance using Linear Regression, ANN, or SVR
* 🧠 Recommend personalized exercise routines based on user profile

---

## 📌 Features

### 1. **Exercise Detection & Rep Counter**

* Real-time webcam tracking using [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)
* Tracks Squats and Push-ups
* Displays rep count and joint angles

### 2. **Posture Analysis**

* Upload videos or use live camera to get:

  * Posture accuracy score
  * Real-time visual feedback and improvement tips

### 3. **Reps Forecasting (AI-Powered)**

* Input your past reps
* Forecast future reps using:

  * Linear Regression
  * Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  * Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Visual and statistical insights

### 4. **Custom Routine Generator**

* Users enter:

  * Age, Height, Weight
  * Personal bests (max reps, confidence reps, etc.)
* AI predicts suggested reps, sets, and duration per workout
* Includes save to `.csv` functionality
